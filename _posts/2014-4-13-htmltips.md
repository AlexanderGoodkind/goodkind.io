Okay so the way I learned HTML was I just Googled "learn HTML" (simple right?) and it was!

I came across an amazing website called [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) and get to reading!

Just taking basic steps in learning the tags & CSS skills of HTML will definitly kick start you in the right direction! No need to jump right into jQuery just yet! learn the basics first!

Jump right in: open notepad (windows) or textedit (mac) type this: 

~~~ markup
<h1>I'm writing HTML!</h1>
~~~  

then save as index.html; now open in your choice of browser and look!
