published: false

This tutorial will show you how to obtain free Dyanamic DNS using any domain provider and a free service called CloudFlare
---

The first thing you will need to do is sign up for an account on [CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com)

Once you have signed up for CloudFlare you want to add a website then write down the "Name Servers" they give you, you will need these later on:

So now you will want to goto your domain provider (for me its [NameCheap](http://www.namecheap.com/?aff=68840)) and change your Name Servers to the ones given to you by CloudFlare
