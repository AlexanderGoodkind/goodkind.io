# Hello!

I am a computer science student and I recently finished a Summer Software Engineering Internship [@Tumblr](https://tumblr.com/) where I worked on the Site Reliability Systems team to improve server automation. I am now currently a mentee [@OutInTech](https://outintech.com) and a Coding Bootcamp Teaching Assistant [@The University of Pennsylvania](https://bootcamp.sas.upenn.edu/).
